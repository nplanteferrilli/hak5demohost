This is just the netcat reimplementation from nmap since defender currently catches any build of regualr netcat and kills the process. I might toss this for a different remote shell approach. I'm sure Windows Defender will start flagging this eventually. It might already, only time will tell.

Taking this down in a few months I don't want a bad actor using this to do actual attacks.
